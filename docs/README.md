## Project Description

In order to practice and demonstrate the knowledge acquired in virtual classes, this project consists of developing a web application similar to Wallapop. JavaScript libraries or frameworks are not allowed, although external CSS utilities can be used.  
Additionally, a `db.json` file must be provided for the backend with the example data required for grading the assignment.

### 1. Ads List

- Each ad should display its image (if available), name, description, price, and whether it is for buying or selling.  
- Ads must be fetched through an endpoint.  
- The listing screen must handle all interface states:

  - **Empty** (no ads).
  - **Error** (failed to load ads).
  - **Loading** (while ads are being loaded).
  - **Success** (when ads have been successfully loaded).

- Clicking on an ad should take the user to its detail screen.  
- If the user is logged in, a button should be displayed to access the ad creation screen.

### 2. Ad Detail

- It should display the image (if available), name, description, price, and whether it's for buying or selling.  
- It should manage all interface states:

  - **Empty** (the ad does not exist).
  - **Error** (failed to load the ad information).
  - **Loading** (while the information is being loaded).
  - **Success** (when the information has been successfully retrieved).

- If the user is authenticated and the ad belongs to them, a button to delete it should be shown (with confirmation).

### 3. Ad Creation

- It should include a form with the following fields:
  - **Photo** (optional).
  - **Name** (required).
  - **Description** (required).
  - **Price** (required).
  - **Buy/Sell** (required).

- When the form is submitted, a request should be made to the backend to save the ad.  
- The interface states must be managed:

  - **Error** (failed to save the ad).
  - **Loading** (while the ad is being saved).
  - **Success** (when the ad has been successfully saved).

- This screen can only be accessed if the user is logged in. Otherwise, the user should be redirected to the listing screen with a message explaining the reason.

### 4. Login

- It should display a form with username and password fields.  
- Upon form submission, the user should be authenticated against the backend and a JWT token should be obtained.  
- The states: loading, error, and success must be managed.

### 5. Registration

- Similar to the login screen.  
- It should register the user in the backend.  
- The states: loading, error, and success must be managed.

## Optional

- Pagination for ads in the listing (the API returns only 10 by default).
- Ads search.
- Ad editing (only if the user is the owner).
- Static tag filtering.
- Making the tags dynamic.

## REST API for the Assignment

To emulate a database, **sparrest.js** will be used, a REST API created by instructor Alberto Casero (KeepCoding), based on `json-server`.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kasappeal/sparrest.js.git
```

This will start the server and activate the REST API so you can interact with the simulated database.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring content and creating the page layout.
- **CSS**: For the design and visual styling of the page, ensuring an attractive and consistent user experience.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

### Software Requirements

- **Visual Studio** (Tested on version 1.99.0)
- **Live Server** (Visual Studio Addon, Optional)

### Program Descriptions

- **Visual Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) needed to run the project. Make sure to use version 1.99.0 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Live Server**: Visual Studio extension that allows viewing HTML files locally in a browser, showing real-time changes.

### Steps to Use This Project

1. Download the compressed file of the project from GitHub to your computer or clone it via SourceTree.

2. Once downloaded or cloned, add it to your workspace in Visual Studio Code.

3. After downloading Sparrest, update its dependencies. Then, to incorporate the tested database into this project, copy the `db.json` file from this project and replace it with the one generated by Sparrest once initialized.

To start the database, simply run the following command inside the Sparrest directory:

```bash
npm start
```

### Notes

- The `db.json` file contains three accounts and 14 posts. These are the credentials for each account to log in and edit the posts already created:

- [pablsch.it@gmail.com](mailto:pablsch.it@gmail.com) / pwd: 123456
- [Pedro.it@gmail.com](mailto:Pedro.it@gmail.com) / pwd: 123456
- [jose.JJ@gmail.com](mailto:jose.JJ@gmail.com) / pwd: 123456
